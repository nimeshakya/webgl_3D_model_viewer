# WebGL 3D Model Viewer

A "from-scratch" **WebGL-based 3D model viewer** that allows you to load, display, and interact with 3D objects directly in the browser.
This project was built as part of my learning journey from the **University of Utahâ€™s Computer Graphics course.**
Iâ€™ve included some of the models and texture files provided in that course for demonstration purposes.

## âœ¨ Features
- Load and render 3D models in WebGL
- Apply textures and basic shading
- Interactive camera controls (rotate, zoom, pan)
- Includes example models and textures

## ðŸš€ Running the Project
